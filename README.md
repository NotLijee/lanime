# Story 
Lanime was born from a love of anime and a desire to make programming as exciting as an epic battle between rivals. Inspired by the legendary worlds of One Piece, Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, and Gintama, this language embodies the spirit of adventure, relentless training, and the power of friendship. Just like a shōnen protagonist, Lanime grows stronger with every challenge, making coding feel less like a chore and more like an anime.


# Features  
1. Character Inspired Syntax
- luffy – Declares a variable with boundless potential (let equivalent).
- kamehameha – Defines a function with explosive power (def equivalent).
- rasengan – Executes a loop with dynamic energy (for equivalent).
- sanji – Defines a conditional block with sharp logic (if equivalent).
- gintama – A wildcard statement for unexpected humor (used for debugging).

2. Type System & Data Structures
- devilFruit <String> – A string type.
- chakra <int> – An integer.
- ki <float> – A floating-point number.
- squad [List] – A list type.
- radar <Map> – A dictionary type.

4. Control Flow That Feels Like a Battle
- gear_second { ... } – Boosts loop performance (optimized loop execution).
- ultra_instinct { ... } – Executes a function with maximum efficiency.
- shadow_clone { ... } – Creates parallel threads for multitasking.

6. Error Handling: No Pain, No Gain
- itachi – Handles exceptions with deep sacrifice (try equivalent).
- genjutsu – Catches errors before they break reality (catch equivalent).

8. Built-in Anime References
- senzu_beans() – Restores all memory leaks and performance issues.
- dattebayo() – Adds unnecessary print statements for dramatic effect.

10. Special Easter Eggs
- If saitama() is called, the program finishes in one punch (instantly).

# Example
```python
#Example 1
kamehameha fizzbuzz(n: chakra):
    rasengan i in range(1, n + 1):
        sanji i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            dattebayo("LuffyBuzz")
        sanji i % 3 == 0:
            dattebayo("Luffy")
        sanji i % 5 == 0:
            dattebayo("Buzz")
        sanji:
            dattebayo(i)

fizzbuzz(15)

#Example 2
kamehameha find_strongest(squad: list) -> chakra:
    strongest = nakama[0]  # Start with the first warrior
    rasengan warrior in nakama:
        sanji warrior > strongest:
            strongest = warrior  # Update strongest warrior
    return strongest

fighters = [900, 1500, 3200, 5000, 10000, 5300, 4200]
dattebayo("The strongest warrior has a power level of:", find_strongest(fighters))
